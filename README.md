# DogRetriever

DogRetriever is a SwiftUI-based iOS application that allows users to explore various dog breeds through a scrollable list and searchable text field. 
By selecting a breed, users can view detailed characteristics and browse multiple images of each dog breed.

## Features

- **Bilingual Support:** Available in English and French.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for all iPhone screen sizes, with adaptive layouts in both portrait and landscape orientations.
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Supports light and dark themes to match the userâ€™s system preference.
- **Offline Caching:** Images are cached to allow offline viewing of previously visited breeds.

## Technical Highlights

- **SwiftUI & Combine:** The app is primarily built using SwiftUI for a clean, responsive UI, with a portion of functionality implemented in Combine (ImageLoader) to showcase its feasibility alongside modern async/await patterns.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes Swinject for dependency injection, minimizing library dependencies and promoting modular, testable code architecture.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests have been implemented to demonstrate how to proceed, the codebase is not enterily covered to keep the development of this demo app in a smaller range of time

## Additional Notes

This project emphasizes a minimal external dependency approach, focusing on native iOS development practices.
